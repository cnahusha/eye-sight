# eye-sight
repo to track improvement of my eye sight


## Action Plan
The best time to practise this is right before sleep. 
The only thing you are going to think about is relaxing eye muscles. First 30 minutes. 
The next 30 minutes of watching near and farther objects is in the morning. 

This will be my top priority sense organ shaping for the next 3 months. 3 months to completely fix my eyes. 

The ugly reality is, If I had started right on the day I posted on Github, I would be past 1/3rd of my journey. 

The most important thing is to dream less, and context-switch quicker, and talk less. Very Very less. Also limit your dreams.
