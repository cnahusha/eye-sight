Here I am starting my journey to improve my eyesight amongst other things. 

World is full of shit. They all have problems, and they are full of shit. 

Why should I worry about anybody? I have myself, and I can improve myself. That is what I will do. 

On this day, the power of my fucked-up eyes is -3.75D(both), with cylindrical axis (not sure of angle) fuck-up as well. 

Plan: 

For the next 30 days, I will spend 1 hour of my day: 
1. closing my eyes for 30 minutes - only trying to relax all my nerves involved. 
2. opening my eyes, and alternating between near and farther views for clearer sight/vision. 
3. Tabulate effort and observations on day's end before sleeping.
